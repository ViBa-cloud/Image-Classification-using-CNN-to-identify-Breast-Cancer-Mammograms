# Image-Classification-using-CNN-to-identify-Breast-Cancer-Mammograms
This project was part of course requirement for EECS 545 (Machine Learning) course for Winter 2023 semester at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor. 

In this analysis, we applied the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and ViT (Visual Transformer) models, mostly CNN, to detect breast cancer from mammogram images and evaluate the model performances based on the preprocessing methods and steps. The data was taken from a Kaggle competition published by RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/data. 

According to our experiments with 5-fold cross-validation, we found that the most composite setting with ROI cropping, thresholding, augmentation, and auxiliary variables predictions performs best in CNN (ResNeXt) architecture.
